## Questions to Resolve

1. **Progress Calculation**: Should partially completed readings count toward topic progress?
2. **Enrollment Restrictions**: Can learners enroll in multiple plans simultaneously?
3. **Completion Criteria**: What defines a "completed plan" - all required topics or all topics?
4. **Notifications**: Should we notify users of new plan assignments? (Future feature)
5. **Discussion Forums**: Should each plan/topic have a discussion space? (Future feature)

---

**Note**: Priorities and estimates can be adjusted based on team capacity and user feedback. Focus on completing critical path items first to establish a functional end-to-end workflow.
