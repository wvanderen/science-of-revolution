# BMAD Methodology Integration Notes

## Current State vs BMAD Principles

**Strengths (Already BMAD-Compliant):**
- ✅ Feature-based organization
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Strong testing foundation
- ✅ Clean data access layer (repositories)
- ✅ Component composition patterns

**Areas for BMAD Improvement:**
- ❌ Reader component violates single responsibility principle
- ❌ Complex state management in monolithic component
- ❌ Missing integration test coverage
- ❌ Business logic mixed with UI logic

## BMAD Re-architecture Strategy

1. **Decomposition**: Break God component into focused, single-responsibility components
2. **State Management**: Implement Context + custom hooks pattern for complex state
3. **Business Logic Separation**: Extract business logic into services and utilities
4. **Testing Enhancement**: Add comprehensive integration and E2E tests
5. **Documentation**: Maintain excellent documentation standards during refactor

This brownfield architecture document provides the foundation for systematic re-architecture while preserving the excellent existing foundation of the Science of Revolution platform.
