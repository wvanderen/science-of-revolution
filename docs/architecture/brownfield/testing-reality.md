# Testing Reality

## Current Test Coverage

- **Unit Tests**: Good coverage for individual components and hooks
- **Component Tests**: ReaderToolbar, ReaderContent, utility hooks well tested
- **Integration Tests**: Minimal, especially for reader component interactions
- **E2E Tests**: Basic user flows covered, complex reader interactions missing

## Testing Gaps

- **Reader Component**: Missing integration tests for the 1,127-line component
- **State Interactions**: Complex state changes not thoroughly tested
- **Progress Tracking**: Edge cases in progress restoration need coverage
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Complex shortcut combinations not tested
