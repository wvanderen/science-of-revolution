# Enhancement Scope and Integration Strategy

## Enhancement Overview

**Enhancement Type:** Component re-architecture with BMAD methodology adaptation
**Scope:** Decompose monolithic 1,127-line ReaderPage component into focused, maintainable components following BMAD principles
**Integration Impact:** High - Requires careful state management redesign while preserving existing functionality

## Integration Approach

**Code Integration Strategy:** Gradual decomposition of ReaderPage.tsx into focused components while maintaining existing interfaces and functionality
**Database Integration:** No database schema changes required - re-architecture is frontend-only
**API Integration:** Maintain existing React Query patterns and Supabase client usage
**UI Integration:** Preserve existing ReaderContent and ReaderToolbar components, decompose only the monolithic coordination logic

## Compatibility Requirements

- **Existing API Compatibility:** 100% backward compatibility required - no breaking changes to user experience
- **Database Schema Compatibility:** No changes to existing Supabase schema or types
- **UI/UX Consistency:** Must maintain exact same user interface and interaction patterns
- **Performance Impact:** Cannot degrade performance - must maintain or improve reading experience
