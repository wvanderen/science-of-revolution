# Introduction

This document outlines the architectural approach for enhancing Science of Revolution with **Reader Component Re-architecture and BMAD Methodology Adaptation**. Its primary goal is to serve as the guiding architectural blueprint for AI-driven development of new features while ensuring seamless integration with the existing system.

**Relationship to Existing Architecture:**
This document supplements the existing architecture plan (docs/architecture.md) by defining how the reader component re-architecture will integrate with current systems. The re-architecture will transform the monolithic ReaderPage component into a maintainable, feature-based architecture while preserving all existing functionality.
