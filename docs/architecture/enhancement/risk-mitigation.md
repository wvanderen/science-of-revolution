# Risk Mitigation

## Technical Risks

1. **State Management Complexity**
   - **Risk:** New state management could introduce bugs
   - **Mitigation:** Incremental migration with comprehensive testing

2. **Performance Degradation**
   - **Risk:** Component decomposition could affect performance
   - **Mitigation:** Performance monitoring and optimization

3. **Breaking Changes**
   - **Risk:** Re-architecture could introduce breaking changes
   - **Mitigation:** Strict backward compatibility requirements

## Mitigation Strategies

1. **Incremental Deployment:** Replace components one at a time
2. **Comprehensive Testing:** Unit, integration, and E2E tests at each step
3. **Feature Flags:** Ability to rollback to original implementation
4. **Performance Monitoring:** Track performance metrics throughout migration
