# Next Steps

## Immediate Actions

1. **Review and Approve Architecture:** Stakeholder review of this enhancement architecture
2. **Set Up Development Environment:** Ensure testing infrastructure is ready
3. **Create Detailed Implementation Stories:** Break down each phase into detailed development stories
4. **Establish Success Metrics:** Define measurable criteria for successful re-architecture

## Story Manager Handoff

**First Implementation Story:** ReaderProgressTracker Component
- **Reference:** This brownfield enhancement architecture document
- **Key Requirements:** Extract progress tracking logic from ReaderPage, maintain exact functionality, comprehensive test coverage
- **Integration Points:** Existing progress feature, React Query patterns
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Progress tracking works identically to current implementation
  - 100% test coverage
  - No performance degradation
  - Clean separation of concerns

## Developer Handoff

**Development Guidelines:**
- **Reference:** This architecture document and existing coding standards
- **Integration Requirements:** Maintain exact same user experience and functionality
- **Testing Requirements:** Comprehensive testing for each component before integration
- **Performance Requirements:** No degradation in reading experience performance
- **Code Review Focus:** Architectural compliance, backward compatibility, test coverage

This brownfield enhancement architecture provides a comprehensive roadmap for transforming the monolithic reader component into a maintainable, feature-based architecture while preserving all existing functionality and improving the overall system design.
