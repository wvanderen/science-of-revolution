# Implementation Strategy

## Guiding Principles

1. **Zero Breaking Changes:** Maintain 100% functional compatibility throughout the process
2. **Incremental Migration:** Replace one component at a time with full testing
3. **Comprehensive Testing:** Every new component must have complete test coverage
4. **Performance Preservation:** No degradation in reading experience performance

## Migration Approach

- **Parallel Development:** New components developed alongside existing code
- **Feature Flags:** Ability to switch between old and new implementations
- **Gradual Integration:** Components integrated incrementally with thorough testing
- **Rollback Capability:** Always maintain ability to revert to previous implementation
