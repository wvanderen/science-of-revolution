interface UserProfile {
  id: string;
  display_name: string;
  avatar_url?: string;
  bio?: string;
  reading_preferences: {
    font_size: number;
    theme: 'light' | 'dark';
    reading_speed: 'slow' | 'normal' | 'fast';
  };
  privacy_settings: {
    profile_visibility: 'public' | 'cohorts' | 'private';
    share_reading_progress: boolean;

**Component Template Pattern:**
```typescript
interface ProfileConfigurationProps {
  userId: string;
  onSave?: (profile: UserProfile) => void;
}

export const ProfileConfiguration: React.FC<ProfileConfigurationProps> = ({
  userId,
  onSave
}) => {
  const { data: profile, isLoading, updateProfile } = useUserProfile(userId);

  const handleSubmit = async (formData: UserProfileFormData) => {
    await updateProfile(formData);
    onSave?.(profile!);
  };

  if (isLoading) return <ProfileSkeleton />;

  return (
    <ProfileForm
      initialData={profile}
      onSubmit={handleSubmit}
    />
  );
};
```
[Source: docs/architecture/fullstack-launch-features.md lines 561-586]

### State Management

**React Query Integration:**
- Use React Query for server state synchronization with Supabase
- Implement optimistic updates for better UX
- Handle cache invalidation and error states
- Follow existing React Query patterns from codebase

**Form State Management:**
- Use React Hook Form or similar for form handling
- Implement field-level validation
- Handle form submission and reset states
- Integrate with React Query for data persistence

[Source: docs/architecture/fullstack-launch-features.md lines 612-616]

### API Integration

**Repository Layer Usage:**
```typescript
// Use existing ProfilesRepository from Story 2.1
import { ProfilesRepository } from '@/lib/repositories/profiles';

// Hook pattern for profile operations
const useProfileUpdate = () => {
  return useMutation({
    mutationFn: ({ userId, updates }: { userId: string; updates: Partial<UserProfile> }) =>
      profilesRepository.updateProfile(userId, updates),
    onSuccess: () => {
      queryClient.invalidateQueries(['profile']);
    }
  });
};
```
[Source: src/lib/repositories/profiles.ts, architecture patterns]

### Routing Integration

**Route Addition:**
Add to existing AppRoutes.tsx structure:
```typescript
<Route path="profile" element={<ProfilePage />} />
```
[Source: src/routes/AppRoutes.tsx existing pattern]

### Form Validation Requirements

**Validation Rules:**
- display_name: required, min 2 characters, max 50 characters
- bio: optional, max 500 characters
- font_size: number between 8 and 32
- All privacy settings: required boolean values

**Validation Library:**
Use React Hook Form with Yup or Zod for schema validation, following existing form patterns in the codebase.

## Dev Agent Record

### Context Reference
- docs/stories/story-context-2.2.xml (to be generated)

### Agent Model Used
Codex (GPT-5)

### Debug Log References
- 2025-10-19: Task 1 plan (AC1) – audited current route map/AppLayout integration and confirmed space for `/profile` entry before scaffolding feature structure.
- 2025-10-19: Tasks 2 implementation (AC1, AC2) – created profile feature folder, ProfilePage wrapper, and ProfileConfiguration container wired to ProfilesRepository + React Query.
- 2025-10-19: Tasks 3-4 build (AC3, AC4) – delivered reading preferences and privacy panels with shared state management, optimistic cache updates, and repository integration.
- 2025-10-19: Tasks 5-6 execution (AC2, AC5) – added validation, avatar placeholder, preview card, toast feedback, and reset/save controls aligned with acceptance criteria.
- 2025-10-19: Task 7 validation (IV1, IV2, IV3) – authored Vitest suites for hooks/components; observed global `npm run typecheck` failures in pre-existing reader modules, documented for follow-up.

### Completion Notes List
- `/profile` route now renders ProfilePage and ProfileConfiguration with modular form, preview, and optimistic mutation flow satisfying AC1–AC2.
- Reading preferences and privacy controls persist through ProfilesRepository with React Query invalidation, meeting AC3–AC4 and exercising IV1–IV3 scenarios.
- Validation, toast feedback, and hook/component unit tests cover AC5; repo-wide typecheck currently blocked by legacy reader typing issues (recorded for next pass).

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-20

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The Profile Configuration Interface implementation demonstrates solid architecture and adherence to established patterns. The code is well-structured with clear separation of concerns, proper TypeScript typing, and comprehensive error handling. The implementation successfully meets all acceptance criteria with good test coverage and user experience considerations.

**Strengths:**
- Excellent component architecture following feature-based organization
- Proper React Query integration with optimistic updates
- Comprehensive form validation and error handling
- Good accessibility implementation with ARIA labels and semantic HTML
- Strong TypeScript typing throughout the codebase
- Well-structured test files with good coverage

**Areas of concern:**
- Font size clamping logic improved (completed)
- Some validation rules are overly restrictive (bio minimum length) - optional improvement

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: `src/features/profiles/components/ProfileConfiguration.tsx`
  - **Change**: Improved font size validation logic
  - **Why**: Original clamping had edge cases with NaN values
  - **How**: Added proper NaN handling with fallback to 18px default

- **File**: `src/features/profiles/components/ProfileConfiguration.tsx`
  - **Change**: Optimized validation error clearing
  - **Why**: Better UX by clearing errors immediately on field change
  - **How**: Added field-specific error clearing in handleFieldChange
