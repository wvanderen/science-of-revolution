# Story 1.3: Reader Navigation Component Decomposition

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** user navigating reading materials,
**I want** to have consistent navigation controls separated from the main reader interface,
**so that** navigation features are reliable and maintainable.

## Acceptance Criteria

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 1.2 successfully extracted ReaderProgressTracker component and useReaderProgress hook, with key learnings:
- Component extraction requires careful handling of ref management and cleanup
- Observer patterns (IntersectionObserver, ResizeObserver) need proper lifecycle management
- URL parameter updates should be preserved during navigation state changes
- E2E tests may need updates to locate new components [Source: Story 1.2 completion notes]

### Data Models

**Navigation State from ReaderContext:**
```typescript
interface ReaderNavigationState {
  currentSectionId: string | null;
  sectionRefs: Map<string, HTMLElement>;
  observer: IntersectionObserver | null;
  isProgrammaticScroll: boolean;
}
```
[Source: ReaderContext.tsx#lines 5-21]

**Navigation Actions:**
```typescript
interface ReaderNavigationActions {
  setCurrentSectionId: (id: string | null) => void;
  registerSectionRef: (sectionId: string, element: HTMLElement | null) => void;
  handleSectionChange: (sectionId: string) => void;
}
```
[Source: ReaderContext.tsx#lines 25-27]

### Component Specifications

**ReaderSectionNavigator Component Requirements:**
- Must encapsulate Intersection Observer for section tracking [Source: ReaderPage.tsx#lines 130-167]
- Must handle keyboard navigation (arrow keys, Ctrl+arrows, Tab) [Source: useParagraphNavigation.ts#lines 133-195]
- Must manage section refs registration and cleanup [Source: ReaderPage.tsx#lines 103-119]
- Must update URL parameters during navigation [Source: ReaderPage.tsx#lines 147-150]

**useReaderNavigation Hook Requirements:**
- Extract section switching logic from ReaderPage [Source: ReaderPage.tsx#lines 270-301]
- Handle Intersection Observer callbacks for section detection [Source: ReaderPage.tsx#lines 130-146]
- Manage keyboard navigation event listeners [Source: useParagraphNavigation.ts#lines 170-202]
- Provide navigation state and actions to components

### File Locations

**New Component Files:**
- `src/features/reader/components/ReaderSectionNavigator.tsx` - Main navigation component
- `src/features/reader/hooks/useReaderNavigation.ts` - Navigation logic hook

**Files to Modify:**
- `src/features/reader/pages/ReaderPage.tsx` - Remove navigation logic, integrate new component
- `src/features/reader/contexts/ReaderContext.tsx` - May need navigation state adjustments

**Test Files:**
- `src/features/reader/components/__tests__/ReaderSectionNavigator.test.tsx`
- `src/features/reader/hooks/__tests__/useReaderNavigation.test.ts`
- Update existing E2E tests in `tests/e2e/story-validation-1.3.spec.ts`

### Technical Constraints

**React Hook Patterns:**
- Must follow existing hook patterns from useReaderProgress [Source: Story 1.2 implementation]
- Proper cleanup of event listeners and observers in useEffect returns
- Use useCallback for stable function references

**Intersection Observer Requirements:**
- Observer must be properly disconnected on component unmount [Source: ReaderPage.tsx#lines 124-128]
- Section ref registration must handle element nulling correctly [Source: ReaderPage.tsx#lines 103-119]
- Programmatic scroll detection must be preserved [Source: ReaderContext.tsx#lines 57-58]

**URL Parameter Handling:**
- Section changes must update URL without creating history entries [Source: ReaderPage.tsx#lines 147-150]
- Initial section ID must be read from URL parameters [Source: ReaderPage.tsx#lines 168-170]
- Navigation must handle cases where section ID doesn't exist

### Testing Requirements

**Unit Testing:**
- Test navigation hook with mock section refs and observer
- Test keyboard navigation event handling
- Test Intersection Observer callbacks and section detection
- Test URL parameter updates during navigation

**Integration Testing:**
- Test component integration with ReaderPage
- Test navigation state preservation across component re-renders
- Test keyboard navigation behavior in browser environment

**E2E Testing:**
- Verify all keyboard shortcuts work identically to current implementation
- Test section switching animations and timing
- Test navigation on mobile devices
- Update existing E2E tests to work with new navigation component

### Performance Considerations

**Observer Management:**
- Intersection Observer should be created once and reused [Source: ReaderPage.tsx#lines 124-128]
- Section ref registration should be efficient and minimize DOM operations
- Event listeners must be properly cleaned up to prevent memory leaks

**Keyboard Navigation:**
- Event handlers should use passive listeners where possible
- Navigation logic should be debounced to prevent excessive updates
- Focus management should be efficient and accessible

## Testing

### Testing Requirements

**Test File Locations:**
- Component tests: `src/features/reader/components/__tests__/ReaderSectionNavigator.test.tsx`
- Hook tests: `src/features/reader/hooks/__tests__/useReaderNavigation.test.ts`
- Integration tests: Update `tests/e2e/story-validation-1.3.spec.ts`

**Testing Framework and Patterns:**

- Use Playwright for E2E tests [Source: fullstack-launch-features.md#108]
- Follow existing test patterns from Story 1.2 validation

**Test Coverage Requirements:**
- Unit tests for useReaderNavigation hook covering all navigation scenarios
- Integration tests for ReaderSectionNavigator component
- E2E tests validating keyboard shortcuts and section switching
- Tests for URL parameter handling and navigation state persistence

**Specific Testing Requirements:**
- Test keyboard navigation (arrow keys, Ctrl+arrows, Tab) works identically

- Test navigation on both desktop and mobile devices
- Test URL parameter updates during navigation
- Test component cleanup and observer disconnection

**Quality Standards:**

- Use ESLint configuration for test code
- Implement proper error handling in navigation components
- Add comprehensive JSDoc documentation
