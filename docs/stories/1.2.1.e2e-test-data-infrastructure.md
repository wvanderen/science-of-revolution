## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 1.2 successfully extracted ReaderProgressTracker component and useReaderProgress hook, but E2E testing revealed infrastructure gaps:
- E2E tests require proper test resource fixtures for scrollable content
- Test data infrastructure needed for comprehensive progress validation
- Performance monitoring required for large document testing scenarios
- Intersection Observer behavior needs proper test simulation

### Current E2E Test Infrastructure Analysis

**Existing Test Structure:**
- E2E tests located in `tests/e2e/` directory [Source: fullstack-launch-features.md#1117]
- Story 1.2 validation test: `tests/e2e/story-validation-1.2.spec.ts`
- Uses Playwright for browser automation [Source: fullstack-launch-features.md#108]
- Test pattern: component detection, functionality validation, integration verification

**Current Test Gaps Identified:**
1. **Test Resource Fixtures:** Tests inject content dynamically but lack structured fixtures
2. **Test Data Management:** No centralized test data management for progress scenarios
3. **Performance Monitoring:** Basic memory checking but no comprehensive performance monitoring
4. **Mock Data:** No standardized mock resources for different document types and sizes

**Testing Framework Details:**
- **E2E Testing:** Playwright 1.48.2 [Source: fullstack-launch-features.md#108]
- **Test Organization:** Feature-based test structure under `tests/e2e/`
- **Test Patterns:** Component detection, functionality validation, integration verification
- **Performance Testing:** Basic memory usage monitoring in existing tests

### Test Resource Requirements

**Document Fixtures Needed:**
- Small documents (single screen, no scrolling)
- Medium documents (2-3 screens, moderate scrolling)
- Large documents (10+ screens, extensive scrolling)
- Documents with varied content structures
- Documents with different reading patterns

**Progress Test Scenarios:**
- Initial page load with no progress
- Progress restoration at various scroll positions
- Progress tracking across different reading speeds
- Memory usage validation during extended reading sessions
- Intersection Observer behavior validation

**Mock User Data Requirements:**
- Test user profiles for progress tracking
- Mock progress data for restoration testing
- Various progress states (not_started, in_progress, completed)
- Session data for authentication-dependent tests

### Test Data Infrastructure Architecture

**Test Data Management Pattern:**
```typescript
// Expected test fixture structure
interface TestResourceFixture {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  content: string;
  sections: TestSection[];
  metadata: {
    size: 'small' | 'medium' | 'large';
    estimatedReadTime: number;
    complexity: 'simple' | 'moderate' | 'complex';
  };
}

interface TestProgressData {
  userId: string;
  resourceId: string;
  scrollPercent: number;
  status: 'not_started' | 'in_progress' | 'completed';
  timestamp: string;
}
```

**Test Utilities Structure:**
- Test data builders for resource fixtures
- Progress simulation utilities
- Performance measurement helpers
- Intersection Observer test mocks
- Memory usage monitors

### Performance Monitoring Requirements

**Memory Usage Monitoring:**
- Track JavaScript heap size during scrolling operations
- Monitor component memory allocation/deallocation
- Validate no memory leaks during extended test sessions
- Measure memory impact of progress tracking components

**Scroll Performance Metrics:**
- Frame rate during scroll operations
- Scroll event handling performance
- Intersection Observer callback performance
- Progress update throttling effectiveness

**Large Document Testing:**
- Test with documents equivalent to book-length content
- Validate performance doesn't degrade with document size
- Test progress restoration with large scroll positions
- Monitor component initialization time for large documents

### Intersection Observer Test Configuration

**Test Scenarios for Intersection Observer:**
- Component mounting/dismounting during scroll
- Multiple section intersection detection
- Viewport boundary behavior
- Performance with many observed elements

**Mock Configuration:**
```typescript
// Expected Intersection Observer test mock
interface MockIntersectionObserver {
  observe: (element: Element) => void;
  unobserve: (element: Element) => void;
  disconnect: () => void;
  // Test-specific methods for simulation
  simulateIntersection: (entries: IntersectionObserverEntry[]) => void;
}
```

### File Structure and Organization

- Documentation coverage for test patterns

**Quality Requirements:**
- Test fixtures should cover realistic usage scenarios

### Future Enhancement Considerations

**Intersection Observer Enhancements:**

**Scalability Considerations:**
- Test infrastructure should support additional component testing
- Patterns should be reusable for other reader component tests
- Performance monitoring should be extensible to other components
