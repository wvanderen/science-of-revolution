## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 2.2 successfully implemented:
- Basic profile configuration interface with placeholder avatar component
- Profile database schema with avatar_url field support
- ProfilesRepository with CRUD operations
- React Query integration for profile state management
- Existing AvatarUpload.tsx component that handles file selection and URL input

Key technical patterns established:
- Repository pattern with ProfilesRepository class [Source: src/lib/repositories/profiles.ts]
- React Query for optimistic updates and cache management
- Feature-based organization under src/features/profiles/
- TypeScript interfaces for UserProfile with avatar_url field

### Data Models

**UserProfile Interface (already exists):**
```typescript
interface UserProfile {
  id: string;
  display_name: string;
  avatar_url?: string;
  bio?: string;
  reading_preferences: {
    font_size: number;
    theme: 'light' | 'dark';
    reading_speed: 'slow' | 'normal' | 'fast';
  };
  privacy_settings: {
    profile_visibility: 'public' | 'cohorts' | 'private';
    share_reading_progress: boolean;
    allow_shared_notes: boolean;
  };
  created_at: string;
  updated_at: string;
}
```
[Source: docs/architecture/fullstack-launch-features.md lines 131-149]

**File Upload Constraints:**
- Supported formats: JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF
- Maximum file size: 5MB before compression
- Avatar sizes: Small (64x64), Medium (128x128), Large (256x256)
- Compression target: Maintain quality under 100KB for medium size

### Supabase Storage Integration

**Storage Bucket Configuration:**
```typescript
// Supabase Storage setup for avatars bucket
const AVATAR_BUCKET = 'avatars'
const ALLOWED_MIME_TYPES = ['image/jpeg', 'image/png', 'image/webp', 'image/gif']
const MAX_FILE_SIZE = 5 * 1024 * 1024 // 5MB
```

**Upload Service Pattern:**
```typescript
// Service pattern from architecture documentation
async uploadAvatar(file: File): Promise<string> {
  const fileExt = file.name.split('.').pop();
  const fileName = `${userId}/${Date.now()}.${fileExt}`;
  const { error } = await supabase.storage
    .from('avatars')
    .upload(fileName, file);
  if (error) throw new Error(error.message);
  const { data: { publicUrl } } = supabase.storage
    .from('avatars')
    .getPublicUrl(fileName);
  return publicUrl;
}
```
[Source: docs/architecture/fullstack-launch-features.md lines 780-795]

### Component Architecture

**Enhanced AvatarUpload Structure:**
```typescript
interface AvatarUploadProps {
  userId: string;
  value: string | null;
  onChange: (value: string | null) => void;
  disabled?: boolean;
}

export const AvatarUpload: React.FC<AvatarUploadProps> = ({
  userId,
  value,
  onChange,
  disabled = false
}) => {
  const { uploadAvatar, isUploading, progress, error } = useAvatarUpload(userId);
  // Component implementation with cropping, compression, etc.
};
```

**useAvatarUpload Hook:**
```typescript
interface UseAvatarUploadReturn {
  uploadAvatar: (file: File) => Promise<string>;
  isUploading: boolean;
  progress: number;
  error: string | null;
  cancelUpload: () => void;
}

const useAvatarUpload = (userId: string): UseAvatarUploadReturn => {
  // Upload logic with compression, progress tracking, error handling
};
```
[Source: docs/architecture/fullstack-launch-features.md component patterns]

### Image Processing Pipeline

**Compression and Optimization:**
```typescript
// Client-side compression before upload
const processImageFile = async (file: File): Promise<ProcessedImage[]> => {
  const sizes = [
    { name: 'small', width: 64, height: 64 },
    { name: 'medium', width: 128, height: 128 },
    { name: 'large', width: 256, height: 256 }
  ];

  // Process each size with compression
  return Promise.all(sizes.map(size => compressImage(file, size)));
};
```

**Cropping Interface:**
- Use react-easy-crop or similar library for cropping functionality
- Maintain 1:1 aspect ratio for avatars
- Provide zoom controls (0.5x to 3x zoom)
- Support touch gestures on mobile devices
