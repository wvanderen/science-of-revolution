## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 3.1 successfully implemented the complete database schema and repository layer for shared notes functionality. The SharedNotesRepository provides methods for accessing shared notes by section and cohort, with proper RLS policies in place.

Key foundations from Story 3.1:
- SharedNotesRepository with cohort-aware data access methods
- Database view (shared_notes_view) with author and cohort metadata
- Proper TypeScript types for shared notes data
- Comprehensive repository testing patterns

### Existing Reader Architecture Integration

**Reader Component Structure (from existing codebase):**
- `ReaderLayoutManager.tsx` - Main layout coordinator
- `ReaderCore.tsx` - Core reading content area
- `ReaderToolbar.tsx` - Reader controls and actions
- `ReaderContext.tsx` - Centralized reader state management

**Integration Points:**
- SharedNotesPanel should integrate with ReaderLayoutManager layout coordination
- ReaderToolbar needs shared notes toggle alongside existing controls
- ReaderContext must be extended to include shared notes state
- Shared notes should overlay alongside reading content without disrupting flow

**Reader Context Extension Pattern (from existing ReaderContext.tsx):**
```typescript
// Existing reader state pattern to follow
interface ReaderState {
  // ... existing state
  sharedNotes: {
    visible: boolean
    notes: SharedNote[]
    filters: SharedNotesFilters
    loading: boolean
  }
}
```

### Shared Notes Data Models

**SharedNote Interface (from Story 3.1 database.types.ts):**
```typescript
type SharedNote = Database['public']['Views']['shared_notes_view']['Row'] & {
  id: string;
  user_id: string;
  resource_section_id: string;
  cohort_id: string | null;
  start_pos: number;
  end_pos: number;
  text_content: string;
  color: string;
  visibility: 'cohort' | 'global' | 'private';
  created_at: string;
  updated_at: string;
  author_name: string;
  author_avatar: string | null;
  cohort_name: string | null;
  note_content: string | null;
  is_author: boolean;
}
```

**Shared Notes Filters Interface:**
```typescript
interface SharedNotesFilters {
  cohortId?: string;
  userId?: string;
  visibility?: 'cohort' | 'global';
  searchQuery?: string;
}
```

### Component Architecture

**SharedNotesPanel Component Structure:**
```typescript
interface SharedNotesPanelProps {
  sectionId: string;
  isVisible: boolean;
  filters: SharedNotesFilters;
  onFiltersChange: (filters: SharedNotesFilters) => void;
  onNoteClick?: (note: SharedNote) => void;
}
```

**Visual Design Requirements:**
- Shared highlights should use distinct colors/borders (e.g., blue tint for cohort, green for global)
- Author attribution with avatar and display name
- Timestamp with relative formatting (e.g., "2 hours ago")
- Interaction indicators (likes, view count)

### File Locations

**New Components:**
- `src/features/reader/components/SharedNotesPanel.tsx` - Main shared notes display panel
- `src/features/shared-notes/components/SharedNotesFilters.tsx` - Filtering controls
- `src/features/shared-notes/components/SharedNoteCard.tsx` - Individual shared note display

**Updated Components:**
- `src/features/reader/components/ReaderToolbar.tsx` - Add shared notes toggle
- `src/features/reader/contexts/ReaderContext.tsx` - Extend state for shared notes
- `src/features/reader/components/ReaderLayoutManager.tsx` - Integrate shared notes panel

**New Hooks:**
- `src/features/shared-notes/hooks/useSharedNotes.ts` - Shared notes data management
- `src/features/shared-notes/hooks/useSharedNotesFilters.ts` - Filter state management

**Test Files:**
- `src/features/reader/components/__tests__/SharedNotesPanel.test.tsx`
- `src/features/shared-notes/hooks/__tests__/useSharedNotes.test.ts`

### Technical Constraints and Considerations

**Performance Requirements:**
- Shared notes loading should not block reading content rendering
- Implement efficient caching with React Query to minimize database queries
- Use virtual scrolling or pagination for sections with many shared notes
- Optimize highlight rendering to avoid layout thrashing

**Integration Constraints:**
- Must not interfere with existing personal highlighting functionality
- Shared notes should complement, not replace, personal annotations
- Reader layout must remain responsive and mobile-friendly
- Accessibility compliance for screen readers and keyboard navigation

**Data Management:**
- Leverage existing SharedNotesRepository from Story 3.1
- Use shared_notes_view for efficient data access with author/cohort metadata
- Implement proper error handling for shared notes loading failures
- Cache shared notes data to improve performance across reading sessions

**State Management:**
- Extend existing ReaderContext rather than creating separate state management
- Persist shared notes preferences in user profile/reading preferences
- Handle real-time updates gracefully (prepare for Story 3.4)
- Manage loading states and error states properly

## Testing

### Testing Requirements

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-21

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation demonstrates solid code quality with well-structured components following established patterns. The codebase shows good TypeScript usage with proper type definitions and interfaces. Components are well-separated with clear responsibilities and proper abstraction layers. The integration with existing Reader architecture is clean and maintains consistency with the current codebase patterns.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: `src/features/shared-notes/hooks/useSharedNotes.ts`
  - **Change**: Updated deprecated `cacheTime` to `gcTime` for React Query v5 compatibility
  - **Why**: Ensure compatibility with current React Query API and prevent deprecation warnings
  - **How**: Replaced cacheTime with gcTime in all query configurations

- **File**: `src/features/reader/components/__tests__/SharedNotesPanel.test.tsx`
  - **Change**: Fixed indentation in QueryClient configuration
  - **Why**: Ensure proper code formatting consistency
  - **How**: Corrected indentation alignment for queries object

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Follows TypeScript and React component standards properly
- Project Structure: ✓ Proper feature-based organization with clear separation of concerns
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Good unit test coverage with React Testing Library
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 5 acceptance criteria fully implemented

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Fixed React Query deprecation warning (useSharedNotes.ts)
- [x] Fixed test file indentation formatting (SharedNotesPanel.test.tsx)
- [ ] Consider server-side filtering for better performance with large datasets
- [ ] Add integration tests for ReaderContext state management
- [ ] Implement virtual scrolling for sections with many shared notes

### Security Review

No security vulnerabilities identified. The implementation properly leverages existing RLS policies from the SharedNotesRepository. Data filtering is handled appropriately with proper TypeScript type safety preventing injection attacks. User permissions are respected through the existing repository layer that maintains Row Level Security compliance.

### Performance Considerations

The implementation includes several performance optimizations including React Query caching, memoization with useMemo, and pagination support. However, client-side filtering could become inefficient with large datasets (>1000 notes). The pagination implementation helps mitigate this, but server-side filtering would be more scalable. Loading states and error handling are properly implemented to ensure good user experience.

### Files Modified During Review

- `src/features/shared-notes/hooks/useSharedNotes.ts` - Updated React Query API usage
- `src/features/reader/components/__tests__/SharedNotesPanel.test.tsx` - Fixed formatting
