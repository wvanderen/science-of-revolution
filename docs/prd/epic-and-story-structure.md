# Epic and Story Structure

## Epic Structure Decision: Multiple focused epics

The enhancement has been structured as four focused epics to enable parallel development, risk mitigation, and better project management. This approach allows different epics to be developed independently while maintaining clear dependencies and integration points.

## Epic 1: Reader Component Re-Architecture

**Epic Goal**: Decompose the monolithic 1,127-line ReaderPage.tsx into maintainable, focused components while preserving all existing functionality.

**Critical Path**: This epic is the foundation for other launch features and must be completed before Shared Notes integration.

### Story 1.1: Reader State Management Refactoring

**As a** developer maintaining the codebase,
**I want** to extract the 15+ scattered state variables from ReaderPage.tsx into a centralized ReaderContext,
**so that** the component architecture is maintainable and state management is predictable.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Create `src/features/reader/contexts/ReaderContext.tsx` with all current reader state
2. Implement `useReader` hook that provides access to reader state and actions
3. All existing state variables are moved to context
4. State update logic remains identical to preserve existing behavior
5. ReaderProvider wraps the reader component without affecting other parts of the app

**Integration Verification:**
IV1: Verify all existing reader functionality works identically after state extraction
IV2: Confirm React DevTools shows clean state hierarchy without performance regressions
IV3: Test that component re-renders are not increased due to context usage

### Story 1.2: Reader Progress Component Extraction

**As a** developer working on reader features,
**I want** to extract progress tracking logic into a dedicated ReaderProgressTracker component,
**so that** progress functionality is isolated and can be tested independently.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Create `src/features/reader/components/ReaderProgressTracker.tsx` component
2. Move all progress-related state and useEffect hooks from ReaderPage.tsx
3. Implement `useReaderProgress` hook for progress-specific logic
4. Progress restoration functionality works identically to current implementation
5. Intersection Observer logic for progress tracking is encapsulated within the new component

**Integration Verification:**
IV1: Verify reading progress is saved and restored identically to current behavior
IV2: Test progress tracking across different reading speeds and scroll behaviors
IV3: Confirm memory usage for progress tracking does not increase

### Story 1.3: Reader Navigation Component Decomposition

**As a** user navigating reading materials,
**I want** to have consistent navigation controls separated from the main reader interface,
**so that** navigation features are reliable and maintainable.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Create `src/features/reader/components/ReaderSectionNavigator.tsx` component
2. Extract all section switching and navigation logic from ReaderPage.tsx
3. Implement `useReaderNavigation` hook for navigation state and actions
4. Keyboard navigation (arrow keys, shortcuts) continues to work identically
5. SectionRefs management and intersection observer behavior is preserved

**Integration Verification:**
IV1: Test all existing keyboard shortcuts for navigation work identically
IV2: Verify section switching animations and timing remain consistent
IV3: Confirm navigation works smoothly on both desktop and mobile devices

### Story 1.4: Reader Input and Highlighting Separation

**As a** user annotating reading materials,
**I want** highlighting and note-taking functionality to be handled by dedicated components,
**so that** annotation features are responsive and maintainable.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Create `src/features/reader/components/ReaderHighlightManager.tsx` component
2. Extract all highlighting, menu positioning, and note creation logic
3. Implement `useReaderHighlighting` hook for annotation state and actions
4. Text selection, highlight creation, and note attachment work identically
5. All existing highlight colors, note editing, and menu interactions are preserved

**Integration Verification:**
IV1: Test text selection and highlight creation across different browsers
IV2: Verify note creation and editing functionality works identically
IV3: Confirm highlight menu positioning and interaction patterns are unchanged

### Story 1.5: Reader Layout and Coordination Component

**As a** developer maintaining the reader interface,
**I want** a clean layout coordinator component that manages all reader sub-components,
**so that** the reader interface is organized and components communicate effectively.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Create `src/features/reader/components/ReaderLayoutManager.tsx` main coordinator
2. Create `src/features/reader/components/ReaderCore.tsx` for the main reading area
3. Assemble all extracted components into a cohesive reader interface
4. Ensure component communication through ReaderContext works smoothly
5. Maintain exact visual layout and responsive behavior of current reader

**Integration Verification:**
IV1: Verify visual layout matches current implementation pixel-perfect
IV2: Test responsive behavior across all device sizes
IV3: Confirm all component interactions and state sharing work correctly
IV4: Validate performance is not degraded compared to monolithic implementation

## Epic 2: User Profile System

This comprehensive PRD provides the roadmap for transforming Science of Revolution from a technically-debt-laden but feature-rich application into a launch-ready platform with clean architecture, collaborative features, and sustainable codebase for future development.

The story sequence is designed to minimize risk to your existing system while allowing parallel development where possible. The Reader re-architecture (Epic 1) is the critical path and should be completed first, while other epics can be developed concurrently.
