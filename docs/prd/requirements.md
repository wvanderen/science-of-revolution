# Requirements

## Functional Requirements

**Reader Experience & Existing Features:**
**FR1**: The re-architected Reader component must maintain all existing functionality including reading, progress tracking, navigation, highlighting, note-taking, and preferences management.

**FR2**: Paragraph focus mode must be preserved and enhanced - users should be able to focus on individual paragraphs with clear UI feedback and navigate between paragraphs using keyboard controls.

**FR3**: State management must be centralized using React Context + custom hooks pattern to eliminate the 15+ scattered state variables in the current ReaderPage.tsx.

**New Features for Launch:**
**FR4**: User Profile Configuration - Users must be able to configure their profiles including display name, avatar, reading preferences, and privacy settings.

**FR5**: Shared Notes in Reader View - Users must be able to see notes and annotations shared by others in the reading interface, with options to filter, toggle visibility, and interact with shared content.

**FR6**: Cohort Viewing and Management - Facilitators must be able to create and manage cohorts, view member progress, and manage group reading activities.

**FR7**: Cohort Member Dashboard - Cohort members must be able to view their cohort's progress, see shared annotations, and participate in group reading activities.

**Technical Architecture:**
**FR8**: The monolithic ReaderPage.tsx (1,127 lines) must be decomposed into focused, single-responsibility components with clear separation of concerns.

**FR9**: All existing keyboard shortcuts and interaction patterns must continue to work identically after re-architecture, with new shortcuts added for the new features.

**FR10**: Mobile-responsive behavior and touch interactions must be preserved across all new components and features.

**Integration Requirements:**
**FR11**: Profile configuration must integrate with existing Supabase auth system and user management.

**FR12**: Shared notes must integrate with existing highlights/notes system and respect user privacy settings.

**FR13**: Cohort management must integrate with existing progress tracking and education plan systems.

## Non-Functional Requirements

**Performance Requirements:**
**NFR1**: Performance must not degrade - page load times and interaction responsiveness should remain at current levels or improve despite new features.

**NFR2**: Memory usage should not increase by more than 15% compared to the current implementation.

**NFR3**: Component re-rendering should be optimized to prevent unnecessary UI updates, especially for real-time shared notes updates.

**Privacy and Security:**
**NFR4**: User profile information must respect privacy settings and only be shared according to user preferences.

**NFR5**: Shared notes must have proper access controls - users should only see notes shared with their cohorts or publicly.

**NFR6**: Cohort management must include proper authorization - only facilitators can manage cohorts they created.

**Quality and Maintainability:**
**NFR7**: The re-architected code must achieve 90%+ test coverage for new components and maintain existing coverage.

**NFR8**: Bundle size should not increase by more than 10% after adding new features.

**NFR9**: All new components must follow accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA) at least as well as the current implementation.

**NFR10**: The architecture should support future feature development without requiring major structural changes.

**NFR11**: Real-time features (shared notes) must handle concurrent users efficiently without performance degradation.

## Compatibility Requirements

**CR1**: Existing API compatibility - All current Supabase queries and data structures must remain unchanged, with new tables/fields added for profiles and cohorts.

**CR2**: Database schema compatibility - Extend existing schema with new tables for user profiles, shared notes visibility, and cohorts without breaking current data.

**CR3**: UI/UX consistency - New features must follow existing design patterns and maintain visual consistency with current implementation.

**CR4**: Integration compatibility - All existing integrations with other features must continue to work seamlessly with the new architecture.

**CR5**: Browser compatibility - Must maintain support for the same browser versions as the current implementation.

**CR6**: Mobile compatibility - Touch gestures, responsive design, and mobile-specific functionality must be preserved for all new features.

**CR7**: Feature toggling - New features should be configurable via feature flags to enable gradual rollout if needed.
