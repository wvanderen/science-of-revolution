# User Interface Enhancement Goals

## Integration with Existing UI

The new UI elements must integrate seamlessly with Science of Revolution's existing design system and patterns:

**Design System Integration:**
- Use existing Tailwind CSS utility classes and typography patterns
- Follow the established color scheme and spacing conventions from the current reader interface
- Maintain the mobile-first responsive design approach used throughout the application
- Utilize existing UI components from `src/components/ui/` where possible
- Preserve the current dark/light theme support and user preference persistence

**Component Architecture Integration:**
- New components should follow the existing feature-based organization pattern
- Profile configuration should integrate with existing user management UI patterns
- Shared notes should use the same highlighting/annotation visual language as existing notes
- Cohort management should follow the same data table and modal patterns used elsewhere in the app

## Modified/New Screens and Views

**New Screens to be Added:**

**1. User Profile Configuration Screen**
- Location: `/profile` or accessible from user menu
- Components: Profile form, avatar upload, preference panels, privacy settings
- Integration: Connects to existing Supabase auth user data

**2. Cohort Management Dashboard (Facilitators)**
- Location: `/cohorts/manage` or `/dashboard/cohorts`
- Components: Cohort list, member management, progress overview, activity settings
- Integration: Links to existing education plans and progress tracking

**3. Cohort Member Dashboard**
- Location: `/cohorts` or `/dashboard/my-cohorts`
- Components: Cohort progress, shared annotations feed, member list, activity stats
- Integration: Pulls from existing progress and highlights systems

**Modified Existing Screens:**

**4. Enhanced Reader Interface**
- Location: `/read/[documentId]` (existing ReaderPage)
- Modifications: Add shared notes toggle, cohort context indicator, paragraph focus enhancement
- Components: New overlays, floating panels, enhanced toolbar elements
- Integration: Deep integration with existing reading experience

**5. Updated User Menu/Header**
- Location: Main navigation header
- Modifications: Add profile link, notifications for shared notes, cohort status

**6. Enhanced Document Library**
- Location: `/library` (existing)

- Integration: Connect reading materials to social features

## UI Consistency Requirements

**Visual Consistency:**
- All new components must use the established color palette and typography scales
- Border radius, shadows, and spacing must match existing design tokens
- Iconography should use the same icon library and style (if one exists)
- Animation and transition timing should be consistent with existing micro-interactions

**Layout Consistency:**
- New pages should follow the same layout grid system and responsive breakpoints
- Modal and panel sizing should be consistent with existing modal patterns
- Navigation patterns (breadcrumbs, back buttons, etc.) should follow existing conventions
- Form layouts should use the same field grouping and validation error placement

**Interaction Consistency:**
- Hover states, focus states, and active states must match existing component patterns
- Loading indicators and skeleton screens should use the same visual style
- Success/error messaging should follow the same toast/notification pattern
- Mobile touch targets should maintain the same minimum size standards
