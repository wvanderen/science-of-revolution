## Daily Standup Questions

1. **What did you complete yesterday?**
2. **What will you work on today?**
3. **Any blockers or issues?**

---

## Definition of Done

For each task to be considered complete, it must meet:

- [ ] Feature implemented and functional
- [ ] TypeScript compilation passes with no errors
- [ ] Manual testing completed for happy path
- [ ] Error states handled gracefully
- [ ] Mobile responsive (tested on at least one mobile device)
- [ ] Code reviewed (if applicable)
- [ ] Merged to main branch
- [ ] Deployed to staging environment

---

## Risk & Dependencies

### Risks
1. **Reader integration complexity** - May require significant refactoring of reader component
   - *Mitigation*: Start with simple plan context banner, iterate on progress sync
2. **Progress calculation edge cases** - Complex scenarios with multiple plans/topics
   - *Mitigation*: Document expected behavior, add comprehensive manual tests

### Dependencies
- Reader component must support URL params for plan/topic context
- Progress tracking foundation (completed Oct 16)
- Plan enrollment hooks functional (completed Oct 15)
