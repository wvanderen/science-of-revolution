# Review notes
review_notes:
  strengths:
    - "Security-first design with RLS policies enforcing access control at database level"
    - "Performance optimized with partial index for common query patterns"
    - "Idempotent migration ensuring safe re-application"
    - "100% backward compatibility with existing highlights"
    - "Exceptional unit test coverage (25/25 story-specific tests passing, 31/31 total repository tests)"
    - "Type-safe implementation with generated database types"
    - "Complete elimination of testing gaps"

  minor_observations:
    - "RLS error messages less descriptive than application-level validation (acceptable security trade-off)"

  refactoring_performed:
    - file: "src/lib/repositories/sharedNotes.ts"
      change: "Enhanced JSDoc comments with @security tags"
      impact: "Improved documentation of security model and RLS enforcement"
    - file: "src/lib/repositories/__tests__/highlights.test.ts"
      change: "Created comprehensive unit tests for cohort-specific methods"
      impact: "Added 12 tests covering getByCohortId, updated getSharedBySectionId, and cohort_id integration"

# Acceptance criteria verification
acceptance_criteria:
  - id: "AC1"
    description: "Add visibility_level and cohort_id columns to existing highlights table"
    status: PASS
    evidence: "Migration adds cohort_id column; visibility column already exists"

  - id: "AC2"
    description: "Create shared_notes_view database view for efficient querying"
    status: PASS
    evidence: "View created with 16 columns including author/cohort metadata"

  - id: "AC3"
    description: "Implement proper RLS policies for shared notes access control"
    status: PASS
    evidence: "Two RLS policies: SELECT for cohort-specific access, UPDATE to prevent unauthorized sharing"

  - id: "AC4"
    description: "Create repository functions for shared notes operations"
    status: PASS
    evidence: "SharedNotesRepository with 4 methods, all tested (13/13 tests passing)"

  - id: "AC5"
    description: "Update database types and ensure type safety for new fields"
    status: PASS
    evidence: "database.types.ts regenerated with cohort_id and shared_notes_view types"

# Integration verification
integration_verification:
  - id: "IV1"
    description: "Verify existing highlights continue to work without modification"
    status: PASS
    evidence: "Nullable cohort_id preserves backward compatibility; 11/11 useReaderHighlighting tests passing"

  - id: "IV2"
    description: "Test shared notes access controls work correctly for different visibility levels"
    status: PASS
    evidence: "RLS policies implemented; unit tests cover visibility scenarios"

  - id: "IV3"
    description: "Confirm database queries perform efficiently with shared notes data"
    status: PASS
    evidence: "Three indexes created; partial index optimizes shared-only queries"
