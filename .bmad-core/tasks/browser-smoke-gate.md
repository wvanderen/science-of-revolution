# Browser Smoke Gate Task

## Overview
Execute comprehensive browser smoke testing as part of QA gate process. This task validates that core application functionality works correctly across different browsers and devices before proceeding with full testing.

## Prerequisites
- Application builds successfully
- Development server is running
- Playwright and browsers are installed

## Steps

### 1. Execute Standard Smoke Tests
Run the browser smoke test suite:
```bash
npm run test:smoke
```

### 2. Run Mobile Smoke Tests
```bash
npm run test:smoke:mobile
```

### 3. Execute Story Validation Tests (if applicable)
For story-specific validation, run:
```bash
npx playwright test tests/e2e/story-validation-{STORY_NUMBER}.spec.ts
```

### 4. Analyze Results
- Review smoke test results in `test-results/smoke/`
- Check story validation results in `test-results/`
- Analyze performance metrics
- Identify any failing tests
- Document any issues found
- Map test results to story acceptance criteria

### 5. Validate Story Requirements
For each acceptance criterion:
- [ ] Verify corresponding test exists and passes
- [ ] Check that implementation matches story requirements
- [ ] Validate integration verification points
- [ ] Confirm user journey functionality

### 6. Generate Gate Decision
Based on results, create one of:
- **PASS**: All tests pass, story requirements validated, performance acceptable
- **CONCERNS**: Tests pass but with performance/story validation concerns
- **FAIL**: Critical functionality broken, story requirements not met, or tests failing

### 7. Create Gate File
Use the browser-smoke-gate-tmpl.yaml template to create gate decision file with:
- Smoke test results
- Story validation results
- Acceptance criteria validation status
- Integration verification status
- Performance and quality metrics

## Exit Criteria
- All smoke tests executed
- Gate decision documented
- Results uploaded to QA gate location
- Recommendations documented for any issues found

## Quality Metrics
- Page load time < 5 seconds
- First Contentful Paint < 2 seconds
- No critical JavaScript errors
- Responsive design works on mobile
- All core user journeys functional
